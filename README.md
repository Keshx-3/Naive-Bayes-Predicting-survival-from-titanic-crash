# Titanic Survival Prediction using Naive Bayes

This project uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict survival from the Titanic crash based on passenger data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Survived`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing
### 2. Model Training
### 3. Model Evaluation
### 4. Results

## Conclusion
- This project demonstrates how to implement a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting survival based on the Titanic dataset. The model shows an accuracy of around 78% with reasonable performance across cross-validation folds
